Sensitive Data Exposure.
Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when security measures fail to protect sensitive information, leading to unauthorized access or disclosure. This can happen due to misconfigurations, inadequate encryption, or other vulnerabilities



Here's a step-by-step guide to exploiting the "Sensitive Data Exposure" vulnerability in Juice Shop:

Step 1: Identify the Vulnerable Endpoint

1. Open Juice Shop in your browser.
2. Use Burp Suite or your browser's developer tools to analyze the HTTP requests.
3. Find the endpoint that handles user data, such as /api/users or /api/profile.

Step 2: Analyze the Response

1. Send a request to the identified endpoint.
2. Analyze the response to see if it contains sensitive user data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identifiable information (PII).

Step 3: Exploit the Vulnerability

1. Use Burp Suite or a tool like curl to craft a malicious request.
2. Modify the request to access sensitive data, such as changing the userId parameter to access another user's data.
3. Send the request and observe the response.

Step 4: Verify the Exploitation

1. Verify that the response contains sensitive data that should not be exposed.
2. Take note of the sensitive data exposed, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or PII.

Correct Exploitation

To correctly exploit this vulnerability, you should be able to access sensitive user data, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by manipulating the request parameters.

Tips and Variations

- Use Burp Suite's "Intruder" tool to automate the exploitation process.
- Try accessing sensitive data using different user accounts or roles.
- Analyze the response to identify potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
