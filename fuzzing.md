Fuzzing in Web Application Security Testing 

To perform a brute force attack on the admin password in Juice Shop, follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the Login Endpoint

Use Burp Suite or your browser's developer tools to analyze the HTTP requests. Find the endpoint that handles login requests (e.g., /rest/user/login).

Step 2: Capture the Login Request

Capture a login request using Burp Suite or your browser's developer tools. Analyze the request to identify the parameters used for authentication (e.g., email and password).

Step 3: Create a Wordlist

Create a wordlist of potential admin passwords. You can use tools like John the Ripper or Crunch to generate wordlists.

Step 4: Configure Burp Suite's Intruder

Open Burp Suite and navigate to the Intruder tab. Configure the Intruder to use the captured login request as a template.

Step 5: Set Up the Brute Force Attack

Set up the brute force attack by specifying the following:
- The email parameter as the admin email (e.g., admin@juice-sh.op).
- The password parameter as the attack point.
- The wordlist as the payload source.
- The number of threads to use for the attack.

Step 6: Launch the Brute Force Attack

Launch the brute force attack and let Burp Suite's Intruder perform the attack.

Step 7: Analyze the Results

Analyze the results to identify the successful login attempt. The successful attempt will typically have a different response code or content length compared to the failed attempts.

Step 8: Verify the Admin Credentials

Verify the admin credentials by logging in to the application using the identified email and password.

By following these steps, you should be able to use the brute force method to find the admin password in Juice Shop.
